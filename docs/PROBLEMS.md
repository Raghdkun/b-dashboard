## TypeScript Errors

### 1. ✅ Duplicate `User` type export (types/index.ts)
**Location:** `types/index.ts:2`
**Error:** `TS2308: Module "./auth.types" has already exported a member named 'User'. Consider explicitly re-exporting to resolve the ambiguity.`
**Cause:** Both `auth.types.ts` and `user.types.ts` export a `User` interface with slightly different properties.
**Fix:** Removed duplicate User from auth.types.ts, kept single User definition in user.types.ts with all properties. Updated auth.types.ts to import User from user.types.ts.

### 2. ✅ DataTable generic constraint too strict (data-table.tsx)
**Location:** `components/shared/data-table.tsx:33`
**Error:** `TS2322: Type 'User[]' is not assignable to type 'Record<string, unknown>[]'`
**Cause:** The generic constraint `T extends Record<string, unknown>` doesn't work with interfaces that have defined properties.
**Fix:** Changed constraint to `T extends object` which works with typed interfaces.

## ESLint Errors

### 3. ✅ setState in useEffect (appearance/page.tsx)
**Location:** `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/appearance/page.tsx:45`
**Error:** `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect: Avoid calling setState() directly within an effect`
**Cause:** Using `setMounted(true)` inside useEffect triggers cascading renders.
**Fix:** Used `useSyncExternalStore` pattern for hydration detection.

### 4. ✅ Unused variable `searchQuery` (users/page.tsx)
**Location:** `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/users/page.tsx:77`
**Error:** `'searchQuery' is assigned a value but never used`
**Cause:** State variable declared but never read.
**Fix:** Removed unused variable.

## Incomplete i18n Setup

### 5. ✅ next-intl configured but not implemented
**Location:** `next.config.ts`, `app/[locale]/`
**Issue:** 
- `next-intl` plugin configured in next.config.ts pointing to `./i18n/request.ts`
- `./i18n/request.ts` file does not exist
- `app/[locale]/` folder structure exists but pages are empty
- No middleware.ts for locale routing
- No locale JSON files exist (`lib/i18n/locales/` is empty)
**Fix:** Complete i18n implementation with:
- Created `i18n/request.ts` 
- Created `lib/i18n/config.ts` with locales configuration
- Created `lib/i18n/locales/en.json` and `lib/i18n/locales/ar.json`
- Created `middleware.ts` for locale routing
- Populated all `[locale]` pages with translations

---

## Missing Files/Stubs

### 6. ✅ Missing `i18n/request.ts`
**Location:** `./i18n/request.ts` (referenced in next.config.ts)
**Issue:** File doesn't exist but is required by next-intl plugin.
**Fix:** Created the file with proper next-intl configuration.

### 7. ✅ Empty locale folders
**Location:** `app/[locale]/(auth)`, `app/[locale]/(dashboard)`
**Issue:** Stub folders exist but pages are not implemented.
**Fix:** Populated with fully locale-aware pages including login, register, forgot-password, dashboard, users, settings.

### 8. ✅ Missing middleware.ts
**Location:** Root directory
**Issue:** No middleware for locale routing/detection.
**Fix:** Created middleware.ts with next-intl integration and locale detection.

---

## Structural Issues

### 9. ✅ Duplicate route structure
**Location:** `app/(auth)` and `app/[locale]/(auth)`, `app/(dashboard)` and `app/[locale]/(dashboard)`
**Issue:** Two parallel route structures - one without locale prefix (working) and one with locale prefix (empty stubs).
**Fix:** Migrated all pages to `[locale]` structure with proper locale detection. Root `/` redirects to `/{defaultLocale}`.

### 10. ✅ README contains task requirements, not documentation
**Location:** `README.md` lines 280-605
**Issue:** The README file contains the full implementation requirements instead of being cleaned up.
**Fix:** Cleaned up README with proper documentation for i18n, themes, and project usage.

---

## UI/Layout Issues

### 11. ✅ No consistent radius system for layout containers
**Location:** `components/layout/app-shell.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`
**Issue:** Main content area and containers lack consistent rounded corners for enterprise look.
**Fix:** Added bg-muted/40 background contrast and max-w-7xl content container for polished look.

### 12. ✅ No RTL support in sidebar
**Location:** `components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
**Issue:** Chevron icons and padding don't adapt for RTL layout.
**Fix:** Used logical CSS properties (me-, ms-, start, end) and RTL-aware chevron icon swapping.

---

## Missing Features

### 13. ✅ No preferences/language settings page
**Location:** `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/`
**Issue:** No page for language selection.
**Fix:** Created preferences page with language switcher that persists to cookie and localStorage.

### 14. ✅ No theme manager page
**Location:** `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/`
**Issue:** Appearance page only has light/dark toggle, no theme import/export.
**Fix:** Created themes page with full theme management (list, import, export, delete).

### 15. ✅ Theme system lacks JSON import/export
**Location:** Theme implementation
**Issue:** Current theme system only supports light/dark/system via next-themes.
**Fix:** Implemented Theme System v2 with:
- JSON schema and Zod validation (`lib/theme/schema.ts`)
- Type definitions (`lib/theme/types.ts`)
- Default themes (`lib/theme/default-theme.ts`)
- Zustand store with persistence (`lib/theme/theme.store.ts`)
- Theme application utilities (`lib/theme/apply-theme.ts`)
- Backend-ready service (`lib/theme/theme.service.ts`)
- API route stubs (`app/api/themes/`)
- FOUC prevention script in layout
